# TODO

This file is fairly self explanatory, no? It's where I'll store things that need to be done for this project.

- [ ] Add support for transports.
  - [ ] Console Transport
  - [ ] File Transport
  - [ ] Mezmo/LogDNA Transport
- [ ] Add support for custom transports.
  - [ ] Allow users of the library to define their own transport class that can be passed in to the Logger.
- [ ] Finish Mezmo/LogDNA support.
- [ ] Add some tests god dammit.
  - [ ] I _was_ using Mocha/Chai to test the library but that has since stopped working and I couldn't fix it. I need to get _something_ working though.
  - [ ] I want to give Jest a try again.
- [ ] Add support for _every_ method that console has available.
  - [ ] For example, things like `console.table` or `console.group`.
