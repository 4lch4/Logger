# Colorize Console Output

I found [an article][Initial-Coloring-Article] and [Gist][ANSI-Escape-Codes-Gist] that demonstrate how to stylize console output (such as changing the text color, adding bold or italics, etc.) using ANSI escape sequences/codes. This means you can stylize the console output without the need for a 3rd party library like [Chalk][Chalk-NPM-Page] or [ansi-styles][ANSI-Styles-GH-Repo].

I found the article when I was trying to make a simple line of text red without using [Chalk][Chalk-NPM-Page], or some other package. I first found [an article][Kindacode-Article] on [kindacode.com][Kindacode] and it linked to the above Gist saying:

> **Note:** You can find more color codes on this [GitHub page][Note-GitHub-Page] or [this Wikipedia article][Note-Wikipedia-Article].

This directory is where I'm storing my initial draft of notes on how to do this.
