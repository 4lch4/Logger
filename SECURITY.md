# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I am willing to support any version of my library that is publicy available and being used by someone. If you encounter any problems whatsoever, please reach out.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As I'm a single developer, if you discover any vulnerabilities in my project(s) then please don't hesitate to reach out to me. While I don't really care how you reach out, the following are the avenues I'm likely to respond the fastest, in order:

1. [Discord][0] — Join my server or send me a DM (@`4lch4#0042`).
2. [Twitter][1] — DM me, tweet at me, etc.
3. [GitHub][2] — Submit an issue on the offending repository, preferably.
4. [E-Mail][3] — Send me a strongly worded e-mail on why I'm an idiot, or whatever tickles your fancy.

Aside from the above, [4lch4.link][4] is my website that provides links and information to all of my public endpoints.
